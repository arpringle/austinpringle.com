                <h1>Building a Modern, Responsive Website with Minimal JavaScript in 2025</h1>
                <time><h6 class="blog-date-line">January 31st, 2025</h6></time>
                <p>
                    Doesn't it seem like there's a new web framework every week these days?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever I step away from the world of web development, I always seem to come
                    back to find that a new framework is the talk of the town, promising to "change
                    the game." The crazy thing is, most of the time, it's actually true! New web
                    technologies are emerging all the time, making development faster and easier.
                    Imagine trying to build today's massive modern web apps if we were still
                    writing HTML from scratch and manipulating the DOM directly with JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I decided to make a personal website to link to my projects, I thought
                    about how, exactly, I wanted to create it. Static site generator? The latest
                    JavaScript framework? Write it in Rust&trade; (somehow)? Eventually, I decided
                    on something a bit more old-school: I chose to build my personal website
                    primarily using good old HTML and CSS. The plan was simple: to see if I could
                    create a nice-looking, responsive, modern website that could theoretically run
                    in a no-JavaScript environment. I did use a bit of JavaScript, but strictly for
                    adding extra functionality&mdash;turning off JavaScript should break nothing in
                    terms of layout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another challenge? I decided to write the whole website with no backend. Yes,
                    the whole website is not only created without frameworks, but it is also
                    comprised exclusively of static files. Even this blog is one big HTML file that
                    I intend to continouously append more articles to! Having no backend has many
                    challenges, which I will get into, but it does have the benefit that I can
                    host my whole site on GitHub Pages!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Am I crazy for trying this approach? Maybe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CSS, and HTML especially, seem to be written by machines more than humans these
                    days. Modern frameworks automate much of the work, and static site generators
                    handle the heavy lifting for simpler projects. In the past, writing HTML for an
                    entire site by hand might have made sense, but today, with the complexity of
                    modern sites, it often feels inefficient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For me, writing a responsive website from scratch without a framework or a
                    backend seemed like a fun challenge&mdash;an opportunity to truly understand
                    the frontend technologies that underpin the web. However, there are good
                    reasons this approach isn't more common these days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this post, I'll walk you through some of the things I learned along the way
                    in making this website: the good, the bad, and the ugly. 
                </p>
                <h2>"You Seem to be Repeating Yourself..."</h2>
                <p>
                    One of the first things I realized when I started trying to write pure HTML by
                    hand was the sheer repetition of it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a point of comparison: one of the primary lessons that gets drilled into
                    your head when learning programming is "don't repeat yourself." This advice has
                    occasionally come under scrutiny, however the logic behind the advice is sound.
                    What it means is this: if you write the same code multiple times, you'll
                    eventually face a headache trying to change something later because you'll need
                    to update every single instance. While writing HTML obviously isn't the same as
                    programming, avoiding repetition still seemed like good practice for similar reasons.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When writing software, if I found myself writing the same code block five
                    times, I'd move that code into its own section and just reference it multiple
                    times. HTML doesn't offer this type of functionality by itself; If I want five
                    of the same element in regular HTML, I have to manually write five identical
                    elements. This is one of the primary benefits of using a framework; reuse and
                    modularity. If you aren't limiting yourself like I am, this modularization
                    problem can be solved in many ways, including both frontend and backend methods.
                    HTML-only modularization isn't something the web necessarily needs&mdash;it's
                    best to keep these lower-level tools simple&mdash;but it would certainly have
                    made my task easier!
                </p>
                <h2>CSS Media Queries are Good, Actually</h2>
                <p>
                    One thing that really shocked me was that you can go very far with CSS Media
                    Queries! You can pretty much handle adaptive layouts and color schemes with minimal
                    effort, as long as you make sure to do it in a thoughtful way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The way I made the site responsive is described below, but be aware that the
                    approach might not be best practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, firstly, there's a CSS unit called <code>rem</code> which is incredibly
                    useful for adaptive layouts; it bases the size of an element off of the
                    <code>font-size</code> property of the root element. If you set the size of
                    your elements based upon <code>rem</code> units, you can just change the
                    <code>font-size</code> property of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element with
                    media queries, and you can automatically adjust the size across the whole
                    document, instead of adjusting each element!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Color schemes aren't too bad either. Just set some CSS variables based on
                    queries, and then use those variables everywhere. If you want a manual color
                    scheme button, however, that still takes some basic JavaScript, as expected,
                    but it's not tough at all. The elegant simplicity of this system cannot be
                    overstated; it "just works".
