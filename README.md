This repository contains the files for my personal website. It's the home for information regarding many of my projects.

It's a simple static site, made without any frameworks in plain HTML/CSS with some basic JavaScript. However, the site should function without JavaScript, for the most part.

It also uses a handy custom Python script to generate the pages from templates. The site is automatically built and deployed via GitHub pages every time the `main` branch receives a commit.

The site is live over at https://austinpringle.com, go ahead and check it out!
