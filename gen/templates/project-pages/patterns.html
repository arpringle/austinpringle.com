    GNOME is a desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. What sets it
    apart from many open-source projects is its extensive design guidelines, known as the GNOME
    Human Interface Guidelines (HIG). These guidelines help non-designers understand and follow
    GNOME's design best practices.

    Originally, Patterns was conceived as a platform demo for GNOME, showcasing its design patterns.
    However, development was largely abandoned because GNOME's core design library, libadwaita,
    includes a built-in demo program, making Patterns seem redundant.

    I am now rewriting Patterns as an interactive version of the GNOME HIG. When complete, it will
    include the full text of the guidelines alongside interactive examples demonstrating their
    application.

    Patterns is written in C, the standard language of the GNOME platform.
