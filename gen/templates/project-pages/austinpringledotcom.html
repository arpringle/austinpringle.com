<p>
    <b>austinpringle.com</b> is my personal website, the one you are on now. It is a static HTML
    site with a few basic JavaScript enhancements.
</p>
<p>
    The site is generated from a series of HTML templates, which are rendered to final HTML by a
    custom Python script using a JSON site description file. Deployment of the site is completely
    automated using GitHub actions; every time I push to the repository, the Python script runs, and
    GitHub pages deploys the site!
</p>
<p>
    I do a deeper dive into how the website works in a recent
    <a href="/blog/austinpringledotcom-complete.html">blog post</a>, if you'd be interested.
