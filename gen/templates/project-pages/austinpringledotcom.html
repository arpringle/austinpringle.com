    <b>austinpringle.com</b> is my personal website, the one you are on now. It is a static HTML
    site with basic JavaScript enhancements.
</p>
<p>
    The site is generated from a series of HTML templates, which are rendered to final HTML by a
    custom Python script. Deployment of the site is completely automated using GitHub actions; every
    time I push to the repository, the Python script runs, and GitHub pages deploys the site!
