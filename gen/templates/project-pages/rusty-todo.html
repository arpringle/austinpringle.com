    <code>rusty_todo</code> is a very simple Rust CLI tool for managing a TODO list. It is written
    in less than 150 lines of code.
</p>
<p>
    It demonstrates competency with many of the core features of Rust, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The ownership system</li>
    <li>Structs</li>
    <li>Enums</li>
    <li>Dervive macros</li>
    <li>The type system</li>
    <li>Data Structures</li>
    <li>Data modeling</li>
    <li>File I/O (synchronous)</li>
    <li>The crate ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It was designed specifically to be a lightweight and small program to show off my ability to
    write idiomatic Rust code.
