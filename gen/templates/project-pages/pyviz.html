    PyViz is a GUI-based Python music visualizer. It has an integrated YouTube search feature,
    allowing you to download any song or video you wish, and see it visualized. The visualizer has a
    few options for customization.

<p>
    The GUI is made using GTK and its companion library libadwaita. The YouTube search and
    downloader are based on the <code>youtube-dlp</code> Python package. The app supports two
    visualizers: the classic, open-source "GOOM" visualizer, and a custom visualizer. For the
    GOOM-based visualizer, we used the Python bindings of the media library GStreamer to connect
    everything. For our custom visualizer, we used the packages <code>librosa</code> for music
    analysis and <code>pygame</code> for custom drawing.
