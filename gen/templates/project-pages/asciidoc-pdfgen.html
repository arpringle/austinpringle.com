    <code>asciidoc-pdfgen</code> is a command-line utility I recently started working on as a way to
    learn about the Rust programming language. It is in its very early stages now; however, it will
    eventually be able to generate PDF files from AsciiDoc documents, with the output PDF being
    themeable via a limited subset of CSS.
