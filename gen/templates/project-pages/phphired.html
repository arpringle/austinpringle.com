    PHPHired is a complete lightweight hiring system. It is written in PHP, and uses MySQL for the
    database.

<p>
    The program allows you to manage HR employees, applicants, job postings, and more, with complete
    CRUD operations, authentication and secure database communication.

    PHPHired was written as a final project for my web programming class. It demonstrates a
    large-scale PHP project with a decent separation of concerns, but, in retrospect, the code could
    potentially be more DRY with a bit more abstraction.
